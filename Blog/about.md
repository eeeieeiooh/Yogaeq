Hi, I'm Devon Wilson. I'm a Photographer based in New York City.

I created this blog as a space to share my thoughts on technology, creativity, and intentional living. I believe in the power of simplicity and the value of taking time to think deeply about things.

When I'm not writing here, you can find me [your hobbies/interests].

This site is built with Hugo—a fast, simple static site generator. No frameworks, no analytics, no tracking. Just words on a page.
