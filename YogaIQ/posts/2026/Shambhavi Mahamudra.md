> You don't really have to do anything, you just have to maintain the space. There are other kinds of practices which you do to build the system to another level. This practice is concentration. – Sadhguru

Just clean it up a bit. The rest will happen.

This makes life quite effortless; and brings you to ease because what you intend, what you want, will naturally start moving your way.

It gives you the freedom to choose today how you want to be. It doesn't matter how you have been in the last ten years.

You will have less and less strong likes and dislikes around you.
