# ESSAY IN BRAIN

# Black and White

One of the big predominants of life is that you dont have infities amount of time. Your path is limited. Furthermore, your actions accumulate. This is karma. Its time And energy.
  
Karmic cycles are similar to feedback loops. You put yourself in situations where you demonstrate the same limiting behaviour that you are trying to stop.
  
Driving and getting angry
Checking social media views (looking for that person)
So what stops what?
Either or. Stop the cycle by bringing awareness into your life in
## Heres the deal with karma
It has to do with your own personal entanglement.
Who’s to say where the boundaries and limitations of your world come from. Society? Family? Friends?
To one person smoking we might be a compulsion. Aka an addict, or even a regular user.
To another it might be a compulsion not to. Aka a strict upbringing.
So the reasons are different, the violation is the same.
Both are karma, but to give them names and differentiate between them is a westerners mindset. To accept them as is
## I believe in generational karma an dreincarnation. I.e you children are you and they live with the pision you infected them with or the love you endowed upon them
Look here it is
If you come from a shit family this is most likely a problem.
If you come froma rich famikt and become complacent you di not survive.
Its a cycle or birth and rebirth with a little death thrown in for funsies
Karma is collouially known as bad karma aka dont do bad things. I love that parents and probably religion have a way of transfering the purity of life into commandments to shape behavior

Is karma memory?
Memory is part of karma and could be a word used to describe its partiality
Its a sort of intelligence. Its not memory although it remmebers.
We are restless creatures. This is what karma gets at. Sit still and there is no karma. Like and dislike and there is lots of karma.
Karma, Behavioural Memory, Muscle Memory, The Power of the Subconsicous
How much is a baseball player thinking of
We call that muscle memory and we are okay
But whats the science behind muscle memory.
We study people that play and we record their improvement. Neural pathways strengthen.
Now take the same thing for behaviour and devise an experiment
My point being is that there is a word for this type of intelligence and it’s karma.
Westerners talk about karma through the lense of habits. Behvaiours that are repeated. Karma is deeper though. Perhaps if you want to start going to the gym you should think about habits, but if you want to liberate yourself from the bondage of human suffering and do anything you ever wanted then perhaps karma is the route.
Is it a 1:1 system where behaviour reinforced because of reward (child screaming gets his ice cream) becomes behaviour forever? No. The system is complex. Mom gives into the screaming once, and doesn’t do it again.
Pavlovs dogs as children. Its a complex system.
Karma is deep beneath the surface. Why do we do what we do? Are we avoiding scenarios that will end up with someone poking
Where did westerners get off thinking their actions were perfectly logical. I dissapear for the night but when i wake up, im
But how do we operate as adults? Wouldn’t it be a shame if we never grew and still had the same modus operandi that we had as children. We still used the princess technique to get our way.
The way you react to your parents when they told you to stop playing video.
We call that your personality.
Personality doesn’t get at the root of karma
Every decision you make is reinforcing
In a complex system like the brain where values determine dreams and dreams on turn direct action.
But where do values come from?
‘You are who you are’
No, you are who choose to be but change isn’t easy
Especially when you’ve reinforced your habitual (and consequently unconscious) behavior with an environment.
## So what..
Karma, yada yada yada. How does it affect my life?
How does one change when they suffer from karma?
change the environment

the business that they worry for no reason at all. This
