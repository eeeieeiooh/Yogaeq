Throughout history and cultures there have always been a select wise few that have been endowed, usually by some higher power, to pass down traditions.

Gurus, mystyics, and sages are spiritual vessels that have dedicated their life to understanding ritiualistic practices and teaching them to people willing to listen.
  
The role of a guru, at least how we know them today, is to help you wake up: to see that what
you thought was reality was mearly an illusion clouded by beliefs about how the
world worked.
  
When gurus talk they specifically use vague langauge because everyone needs to untangle the mess of their own mind. What we want to wake up from is different for all of us. Anger for some, jealously for others. Everyone is at a different stage. Some people don't even recognize that their thoughts are not them.
