Never determine who you are. Leave room for [[The Unknown]]

Sometimes life has plans of its own. 

Looking back at previous years of your life. Why did I wear this? why did i do that? 

We can approach it with respect or sadness. But knowing its a part of your journey is the entirety of it.

Its not about the destination. 

Everyone is at a different stage of their journey.
