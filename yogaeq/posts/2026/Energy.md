People hear the word energy and it scares them. 

Something that is nebulous and can't be defined by [[Science]] except electricity. 

[[Karma]]
# 4 Types of Karma (Action)

**The Four Categories:**

- Physical
- Mental
- Emotional
- Energy

## Energy Action: The Most Impactful

Energy action can have far more impact upon one's life than the other three types, but it must be done the right way.

### What Are Improper Energy Actions?

**Example 1: Thought-Emotion-Action Chain** Let's say you sat here and thought that somebody you don't like must die. On another level, you had a thought, but not just a thought - a strong emotion. You acted upon this thought and emotion, and you actually performed the action where you found a way through which the person you don't like will die.

This is about learning to use energies towards your benefit, not other people's detriment. Whatever you call it - Pilli Soonyam or anything else - the impact of this goes very deep into you because you're employing your energies to do this.

## The Principle of Inclusiveness

**Shambhavi Practice:** You see everyone as yours, so that you never misuse this. You see everybody as yours.

Enhancement of energies has to come with:

- A profound sense of responsibility
- A deeper dimension of inclusiveness

**Critical Warning:** Without inclusiveness, if you use energy, this will be the worst karma.

## Why You Must Never Misuse Energy

Some of you may experience dramatic changes happening in your life because of initiations. Never try to use this ability to transform or to do something else with energy.

**Even "Good" Intentions Are Dangerous:** Some of you think you will do a great thing by healing somebody or intervening in somebody's life in some other way. No, this will be the worst type of karma you perform.

### The Reason Why:

Once you try to use your energies, and still you're capable of anger, **and you're capable of drawing boundaries of what is you and what is not you** - what is yours and what is not yours - when these things are still there, you should never, ever, try to do anything energetically.

This will be the most impactful karma that you will do.

## The Solution: Becoming a Mother to the World

This is the reason why, even for the basic practice of Shambhavi to initiate you, you must become a mother to the world.

If every moment of your life you live with an inclusive emotion of being a mother to the world, not discriminating between what is yours and what is not yours...

Right now, you cannot help discriminating what is you and what is not you, but when you transcend this:

**You have solved the karmic puzzle.**

90% - believe me, 90% - of all dimensions of karma will be resolved.

The remaining 10%? I'm there.
