> The word Ashtanga is comprised of two Sanskrit words, “Ashta” and “Anga.” “Ashta” refers to the number eight, while “Anga” means limb or body part. Therefore, Ashtanga is the union of the eight limbs of yoga, into one complete, holistic system

> And Now, Yoga – Patanjali 


> The Yoga Sutras, also known as The Eight Limbs (Ashtanga) of Raja (King) Yoga, was the first fully developed and recorded system of yoga. Created by Patanjali around 400 CE, this system influences much of the yoga that is practiced today. Although most of the sutras were originally focused on mindfulness, the yoga practiced in the West today seems to focus more on the body. Somewhere along the way, it seems, we began to practice the movement of yoga in isolation from its original philosophies.

## The History

These newer styles of [[Vinyasa Yoga]] are a less structured offshoot of the Ashtanga Yoga system. Ashtanga Yoga has a strict structure and precise set of rules and was developed in by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois. His teacher, [Krishnamacharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumalai_Krishnamacharya), is attributed with being the originator of the Vinyasa concept in yoga. Krishnamacharya’s yoga style was constantly changing as he was a master of adapting yoga to the personality of his students. The yoga Jois learned from Krishnamacharya became his way of teaching all of his students, and he named this style Ashtanga Yoga
