Judgment are the thoughts [[Preferences]].

To judge something as good or bad is to miss the point entirely. 

In Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, the 'Judgment Day' is the day of reckoning. When god brings up a list of all your actions and decides what happens to your fate. 

In Hinduism, every day is judgement day with [[Karma]].

No matter the religion the point remains: your actions.
