[[Language]] is important to yoga. 

Sanskrit is an ancient language. 

It has a great deal of words used to describe the inner workings of the mind. 

Western language has limitations. The term individual, me, you, us, do not allow for the acceptance that there is no relationship and you that it is all oneness

[[Patanjali]] was  thought to be the author of a number of Sanskrit works.

There needs to be a fair deal of respect for one of the oldest spoken language on earth along with Greek, Chinese, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Tamil

There is no other comprehensive philosophy of the mind. It truly is as if one studied from experience**, expounding the knowledge from within.
