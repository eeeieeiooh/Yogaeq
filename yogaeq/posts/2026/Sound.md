Once the idea that basic waves are used in all sounds, you can start to get really specific about the origins of the source material. Sure I can make "anything" from Oscillators, but I can also extract noise / tones from all other recordings. A waterfall is a source of noise, so is a car, so is a modem etc etc. And I can resynthesises these materials into any other sound. E.g. You can build an Organ from your own breath, layered into tonal material stacked up from a recording of a Nuclear Reactor... etc etc

A frequency, pulses in a wave-form

This is very is literal. If there is a sound, there is a frequency of the wave that makes the sound.

If there is a sound, there is a frequency of the wave that makes the sound.
 
In high beta frequency we are typically stressed, and in delta we are typically asleep. 

When we are angry, our heart rate has a high frequency (pulse) and low variability, and when we are feeling loved and nurtured we have a slower pulse and greater HRV.
