## Karma Yoga

- 'The Yoga of Action'
- All of us are in action and we can practice a yoga of action. Do what you conceive to be your duty without desire or fear for the fruits. either for yourself or for others. this is a horrendous teaching. It manifest ins the orient very differently. A persons duty is dictated to him by his society. thats why Krishna says be a warrior. Self responsible criticism, self responsible judgement. Not the good soldier, the good citizen. 

## Jnana Yoga

- Husband and Wife: The level of the nunn, who is the lover of christ. Also Husband and Wife who show love to each other. 
- Illicit Love: Nothing but love. You lose everything for love. They are the supreme lovers. Krishna and the Gopis. Trubidor Love. Not in terms of the social order but in affection. Madness of the hermit. Bodhi Sattva.
