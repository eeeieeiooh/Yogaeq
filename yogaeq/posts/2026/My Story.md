One of the best meta skills you can develop: the recognition of craving or change in the state of your mind. the initial part. this will allow you to make a conscious decision not. This is why meditation is so powerful. it stops you from reacting to these seemingly sporadic thoughts, cravings, and feelings. It helps remind us, as a daily practice, that there is a constant background noise going on in all of our heads. It helps empower us to not listen to this noise but rather tune back into the world and live here, now.

A Gap. 
a gap of time. 
a gap in space.

The past, present, and future are all properties of consciousness. The past is recollection, memory; the future is anticipation; the present is awareness. Therefore time is the movement of thought. Both past and future are born in the imagination; only the present, which is awareness, is real and eternal. It is. It is the potentiality for space-time, matter, and energy. It is an eternal field of possibilities experiencing itself as abstract forces, whether they be light, heat, electricity, magnetism, or gravity. These forces are neither in the past nor in the future. They just are. 

(1) Slip into the gap. This means to center yourself in that silent space between thoughts, to go into the silence — that level of Being which is your essential state. 

(2) Established in that state of Being, release your intentions and desires. When you are actually in the gap, there’s no thought, there’s no intention, but as you come out of the gap — at that junction between the gap and a thought — you introduce the intention. If you have a series of goals, you can write them down, and have your intention focused on them before you go into the gap. If you want a successful career, for example, you go into the gap with that intention, and the intention will already be there as a faint flicker in your awareness. Releasing your intentions and desires in the gap means planting them in the fertile ground of pure potentiality, and expecting them to bloom when the season is right. You do not want to dig up the seeds of your desires to see if they are growing, or get rigidly attached to the way in which they will unfold. You simply want to release them.  – Seven Spiritual Laws of Success
