Space is powerful

Before you act 

One of the best meta skills you can develop: the recognition of craving or change in the state of your mind. the initial part. this will allow you to make a conscious decision not. This is why meditation is so powerful. it stops you from reacting to these seemingly sporadic thoughts, cravings, and feelings. It helps remind us, as a daily practice, that there is a constant background noise going on in all of our heads. It helps empower us to not listen to this noise but rather tune back into the world and live here, now.
