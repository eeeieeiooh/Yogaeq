> These newer styles of vinyasa yoga are a less structured offshoot of the [Ashtanga Yoga](https://www.yogabasics.com/learn/ashtanga-yoga/) system. Ashtanga Yoga has a strict structure and precise set of rules and was developed in by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois. His teacher, [Krishnamacharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumalai_Krishnamacharya), is attributed with being the originator of the Vinyasa concept in yoga. Krishnamacharya’s yoga style was constantly changing as he was a master of adapting yoga to the personality of his students. The yoga Jois learned from Krishnamacharya became his way of teaching all of his students, and he named this style Ashtanga Yoga.
