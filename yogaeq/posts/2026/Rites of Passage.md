**This awakening is a necessary part on the way to manhood. stopping the absorption and reaction of the external and prioritizing the silence within. But when is manhood nowadays? 25?Its when things get real and our society has prolonged the manhood age for the extent of learning. It wasnt so early before when all we did was hunt.**
# The Crisis 

Lack of Spiritual (& Psychedelic) Rites of Passage
  * Ideas
    * The numinous:  having a strong religious or spiritual quality; indicating or suggesting the presence of a divinity. "
  * ## Intro
    * This is a personal topic to me because I feel as if i had a very real spiritual awakening with magic mushrooms @ the tender age of 17.
    * I had to make my own spiritual / transitioning rituals. Luckily I had a friend to guide me and help me grow. Some people don't have this opportunity. 
  * [Ram Dass](https://maps.org/news-letters/v14n2/psychedelic_rites_of_passage.pdf)
    * WE ARE LIVING IN A DEPRIVED SOCIETY, as far as spiritual rituals are concerned. We suffer from a shortage of rites of passage-or at any rate a shortage of meaningful rites of passage. It's true that we get married and we get buried, we have our baptisms and our first communions and our bar mitzvahs, but sometimes they don't seem to touch our hearts very deeply. In the worst cases, they're just episodes we go through mechanically, by rote.
    * If we have only the most superficial of ossified religious rituals, it is because these rites of passage no longer provide direct contact with the numinous. This is where psychedelics can help. But sadly, a first psychedelic experience is much more likely to happen at noisy party somewhere than in a sacred setting filled with reminders of a spirit. And that's a big missed opportunity, for us as a society.
    * Those would seem to be good ground rules for creating a psychedelic rite of passage. Now what if a group of people were to a build a community based on something like that? What would it be like to live in a society that included an initiatory psychedelic experience? That's what Aldous Huxley explored in his novel, Island. At a certain age, the young people on Huxley's island would begin preparing for the psychedelic journey they would be taking; they would begin learning a seri of exercises that would lead them into new terrains of awareness. Adults who emerged from that journey would be prepare to take their place in the society and to play their role from a much deeper level of their being.
    * We could use more books like that, books that offer context for the psychedelic voyage and the psychedelic vision. We could use more rites of passage, whether or not they involve psychedelics, because in a very deep way, young people are yearning for something.-for a symbol, a marker stone, a mythic context that acknowledges the significance and the sacredness of the passage they are making. We owe it to them to develop rites of passage that match the stretch of their spirits. We owe it to ourselves to introduce them to the society of adults from space of unity and love that psychedelics open within us.
