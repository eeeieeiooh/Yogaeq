Intelligence goes beyond the mind. [[Intellect]] is what we describe as IQ in the west. The ability to divide. 

Your body has a natural intelligence to it, and you should interfere with it as little as
possible (loose clothing, no overeating, minimizing smoking, no drinking)

Go out into nature
and appreciate the solitude. Quiet your inner being and listen.




You're life goes in accordance with your intelligence. 

Outside forces don't determine your action.

Everybody's karmic substance and intelligence are tuned in a certain way.

This moment how you are is determined by you,

If you allow that to decide, everything becomes compulsive, your past will repeat itself, it will not allow you any future in life.
