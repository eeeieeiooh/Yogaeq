> Everything can be sadhana. The way you eat, the way you sit, the way you stand, the way you breathe, the way you conduct your body, mind and your energies and emotions – this is sadhana. Sadhana does not mean any specific kind of activity, sadhana means you are using everything as a tool for your wellbeing. — Sadhguru


A sadhana is just the act of practicing [[Awareness]] when you do things. 

Handling one thing at a time. 

Calming the nervous system


Have you ever gone through 24 hours the way you want it? 

The sutra is your life. its the thread that holds it all together. small fragments of reality.

Meditate be still. Appreciate serenity. Don’t overindulge. Balance 

How you wake up

What you do in your free time

Sadhana and sadhna are both related to a Sanskrit word that means "to accomplish" or "to attain": 

**Sadhana**: A daily spiritual practice that is a key tool for developing oneself and reaching a higher level of consciousness. It can also refer to a tantric liturgy or manual that provides instructions for carrying out a practice.     

**Sadhna**: A word that means wealthy or rich. 

Sadhana can involve a variety of activities, including: 

Meditation, Yoga, Prayer, Exercise, Chanting, Asana (postures), Japa (repetition of mantra), Worship (puja), Study (svadhyaya), and Service (seva).

Sadhana is often practiced before sunrise. It can be a way to connect with the Infinite, and is considered a gift or offering to the Higher Self. 

The word "sadhana" comes from the Sanskrit root sādh. The earliest known use of the word was in 1898 by K. L. Sarkar
