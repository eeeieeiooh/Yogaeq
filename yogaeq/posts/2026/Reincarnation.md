- buddhist, Hindu. Fundamental 
- The Soul puts on body's and takes them off. The function of the body is to put you in a realm of experience.
- The notion is that you choose your parents. the soul has a certain need for a certain type of parents. The individual soul may resist these level experiences.  
- The ultimate goal is to not put on any body anymore. To be released. 
- What brings you back. Desire and fear. Desire for life. Fear of death. when you have quenched this.  
- The Illumination comes when you are least ready. 
- Jiva: Veba (latin) The Living force
- The hub is part of the wheel. 
- its wonderfully paradoxical. 
- balance stress and yearnings. thats what all these sy

[A Poem By John Masefield](https://allpoetry.com/poem/8495881-A-Creed-by-John-Masefield)

> I hold that when a person dies  
      His soul returns again to earth;  
      Arrayed in some new flesh-disguise  
      Another mother gives him birth.  
      With sturdier limbs and brighter brain  
      The old soul takes the road again.
