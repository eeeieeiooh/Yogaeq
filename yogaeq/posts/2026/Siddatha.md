Siddatha Gutama

Its not like christ. it doesn't matter weather the buddha lived. its the rendition of the mystery of the Buddhood of life. he can serve as a mythological figure. as an inspiration to find within yourself. buddha images direct your attention. its form, posture. you gotta have someone to point you. 

Siddatha died from meat. Dysentary... Or mushrooms
