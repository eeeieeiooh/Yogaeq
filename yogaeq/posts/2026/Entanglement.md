> When it comes to creation, instead of asking why, if you see, right now you are a part of the creation, and like you said you are entangled and stuck and drowning in the creation. Not everybody maybe, but at least quite a lot of people feel like they are drowning, when things go wrong at least. So right now in some way you are entangled

> “All these entanglements are like the life of the silk moth. Silk yarn is a sort of fleshy, pulpy substance that comes out of the silk moth. When the moth is just a day old, it is the size of a hair. You can have more than a hundred worms within the space of a thumb. The next day, you’ll need the palm of your hand to accommodate them. On the third day, you’ll need a large tray. Within thirty days, each worm is thicker than a thumb and over three inches long. They grow so big within such a short time because they do nothing but eat mulberry leaves.” – The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali
