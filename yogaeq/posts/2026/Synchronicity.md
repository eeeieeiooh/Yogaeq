> “Synchronicity” is the term used to describe the feeling that everything in life — the ups, the downs, the disasters and the triumphs, seem to work together for your good. Author Joseph Jaworski argues that the right state of mind will make you the kind of person who can enlist the cooperation of fate and take advantage of synchronicity, creating the conditions for “predictable miracles.” - Synchronicity: The Inner Path of Leadership

Thoughts and external events align in a way that is significant.

# Amor Fati 

The great German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] would describe his formula for human greatness as amor fati—a love of fate. “That one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backwards, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it….but love it.”

[[Stoicism]]

“Amor fati” is a Latin phrase that translates to "love of fate" or "love of one's fate". It's a concept that describes an attitude in which one accepts and embraces everything that has happened, is happening, and is yet to happen in their life, including suffering and loss. The idea is that everything has a purpose and is good for something, and that one should not only accept their life events but fall in love with them
