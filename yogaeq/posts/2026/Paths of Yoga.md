Intellect

"What I know, I know. What I do not know, I do not know." – Sadhguru

Distinguish between the subject and object of knowledge.

I am not my body i am the knower of my body. I am not my emotions am the knower of the emotions. thoughts. ideals and purposes.

# Karma Yoga - The Yoga of Action

> If you can joyfully involve yourself in any activity, that is karma yoga. If you do it with great effort, _only karma will come, no yoga will happen_! – Sadhguru

> I am 100% Responsible 

All of us are in action and we can practice a yoga of action. Do what you conceive to be your duty without desire or fear for the fruits. either for yourself or for others. this is a horrendous teaching. It manifest ins the orient very differently. A persons duty is dictated to him by his society. thats why Krishna says be a warrior. Self responsible criticism, self responsible judgement. Not the good soldier, the good citizen.

Devotion to god.
