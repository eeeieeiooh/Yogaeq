Do not carried around by compulsions. 

Don't let your past determine what you will do tomorrow.

What you do tomorrow should be suitable for the tomorrow that we see.

You must act consciously. Reacting is unconscious. What would be the true solution. It’s not something that controls your life. No push or pull. 

Take 100%. The choice for your response is completely up to you.
