It's not about using possibility to make a million dollars. It's about shifting your life so you can choose within the bounds of it. You can't have anything you want. But you can get out of your current mindset and make a life full of peace, abundance.

A lot of times you don't need more information. 

You just have to do what's necessariy to make it happens. 

Perhaps what you wanted wasn't what you wanted after all. You aught to get offly clear about it. 




When you allow yourself to just be or open up to the now free of criticism from the mind about anything, it frees you to be able to witness the abundance of life’s possibilities. 

If you notice the mind chatter is always trying to tell you how to feel or analyzing some aspect of or situation from earlier in the day ,for example, you can stop any negative consequences to your mental state from happening as a result. 

It’s true awareness of the two halves of all and the way to breaking any programmed responses from your life. It ain’t easy but nobody said pimpin your mind was lol.

When you become nothing, no one and nowhere, you become everything, every one and everywhere. All potentiality lies within.
