Not to be [[Dogma]].

Don't let it take your [[Responsibility]]


  * Reglion is wack when
it takes away accountability from people
  * Title:
  * The terrible thing
about rligion: it teachs you what god is and because you think you know you can
never know
  * People are being
trapped by the dogmatic believes of their family with love thats supposed to be
unconditional being held hostage
  * The only reason you
are a certain religion is because of where you were born
  * **Religion as 
another Myths**
  * The idea of the
supernatural as being something over and above the natural is a killing idea.
In the Middle Ages this was the idea that finally turned that world into
something like a wasteland, a land where people were living inauthentic lives,
never doing a think they truly wanted to because the supernatural laws required
them to live as directed by their clergy. In a wasteland, people are fulfilling
purposes that are not properly theirs but have been put upon them as
inescapable laws. This is a killer.... The spirit is really the bouquet of
life. It is not something breathed into life, it comes out of life. This is one
of the glorious things about the mother-goddess religions, where the world is
the body of the Goddess, divine in itself, and divinity isn't something ruling
over and above a fallen nature.... Our story of the fall in the Garden sees
nature as corrupt; and that myth corrupts the whole world for us. Because
nature is thought of as corrupt, every spontaneous act is sinful and must not be
yielded to. You get a totally different civilization and a totally different
way of living according to whether your myth presents nature as fallen or
whether nature is in itself a manifestation of divinity, and the spirit is the
revelation of the divinity that is inherent in nature.
  * **Religion in Theory Vs Practice**
  * As an atheiest when i
watch reigious dosputes, i just sit back and laugh. Thinking that these two
idiots are fighting over a flying spagetti monster. Relgion sounds ideal in
theory but in practice was currupted by man to influence culture
  * Im endlessly
fascinated by religion and our need to seek a higher power or do we feel a
higher power. Were these phrophets some how more connected to it? I suppose.
Jesus being a
  * What i dont like is
people blindly accepting reigion as a doctrine without question, people taking
agressive stances torwards other religions in the crowd
  * The
fact that religion helps people quit drugs… AA. Give yourself to a hgiher
power. Theres other things too but this is their staple for a reason… 7 of the
twelve steps refer to a diety. https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/us/alcoholics-anonymous-without-the-religion.html
