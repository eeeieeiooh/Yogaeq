> A dream which is not understood is like a letter which is not opened. – The Talmus

> Sleep takes off the costume of circumstance, arms us, with terrible freedom, so that every will rushes to a deed. A skillful man reads his dreams for his self-knowledge; yet not the details but the quality. – Ralph Waldo Emerson
