 > At this time, people, want to sit up and do their spiritual processes so that they get the most benefit. Brahma Muhurta means the time of the creator. You can look at it this way: it is the time when you can create yourself. You become the Brahman in the morning, so you can make yourself the way you want yourself to be. – Isha, Sadhguru
