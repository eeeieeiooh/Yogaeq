The Goal of Yoga

The word 'goal' has a colloquial meaning that gets misconstrued. 


**Yoga** – Union of body, mind, and soul, and with God

It would be quite odd to jump to the resource section, diving into the intellectual side of yoga when it is inherently an experiential process – but I get it.

Yoga is a spiritual process built-in grounded actuality, not esoteric lessons.

Most people subscribe to religion as dogma. A repeitive process. You can say the prayers. Yoga is about doing.

When you experience everything as one in your consciousness, then you are in yoga. Yoga simply means to be in perfect tune. When you are in yoga, your body, mind and energy and existence are in absolute harmony. [[Sadhguru]]

Meditation is a [[SORT/Import/Spirituality]] process and realization

The body is a big hindrance to meditation: digestion, discomfort, bodily functions all play a role in preventing the mind from being serene.

Without Asanas ('Yoga Postures'), [[Meditation]] is fighting an uphill battle. We aren't accustomed to stillness–we must practice with Sadhanas ('Daily Spiritual Practice').
