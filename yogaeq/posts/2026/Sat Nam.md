Divine truth

The word “Sat” means “Truth” and the word “Nam” means “Name.” The phrase translates to something like “Truth is my Name” or “I am Truth.”

In yoga or meditation, this is often used as a mantra while performing that exercise. However, I’ve found it beneficial to use throughout my day. Silently whispering “Sat Nam” or “I am Truth” helps me to become aware of the areas in my life where I am not living my truth.
