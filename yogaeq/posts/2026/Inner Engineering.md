Just clean it up a bit. The rest will happen.

This makes life quite effortless; and brings you to ease because what you intend, what you want, will naturally start moving your way.

It gives you the freedom to choose today how you want to be. It doesn't matter how you have been in the last ten years.

You will have less and less strong likes and dislikes around you.


The Kriya consists of pranayama (breathing exercises), vipassana meditation, and chanting
