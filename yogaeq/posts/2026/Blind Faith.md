Faith = Happiness
	  - "It's lack of faith that makes people afraid of meeting challenges, and I believed in myself." - Muhammad Ali I have faith that I am where I am supposed to be and always will. I focus on my process and let my results speak. I receive everything I desire: whether it be anger, or joy. I do not let an unknown future stand in the way of me taking steps every day because I know inspiration follows action. I choose the path of my dreams instead of middle class security. I accept the unknown. I know I am on the right path in life. I recognize that everything is a learning lesson and nothing is a failure. I have faith that my audience is out there.
