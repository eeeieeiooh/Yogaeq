Fate is a part of life. 

> - "The ultimate nature of the mind is pure, clear and unobstructed, like the sky. It is not something that can be grasped or obtained, but rather it is the very essence of one's being. Recognizing this essence and remaining in this natural state is the ultimate goal of Dzogchen practice." – Patrul Rinpoche "The Words of My Perfect Teacher"

> God always does that which is best. My param Gurudeva Sitaramdas Omkarnath always said, ‘Whatever happens, it’s always for the best. Sab manga! Sab mangal !’ This was his formula for happiness: Always chant mahamantra and always think that whatever happens it’s for the best. With these two, happiness will be yours! And I have found this to be true. One just has to be trusting and patient.
