Once the idea that basic waves are used in all sounds, you can start to get really specific about the origins of the source material. Sure I can make "anything" from Oscillators, but I can also extract noise / tones from all other recordings. A waterfall is a source of noise, so is a car, so is a modem etc etc. And I can resynthesises these materials into any other sound. E.g. You can build an Organ from your own breath, layered into tonal material stacked up from a recording of a Nuclear Reactor... etc etc
