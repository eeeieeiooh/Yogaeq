Suppose you have mastered the gross elements without going into the subtler ones. You become the controller of the gross elements of nature. If you had stopped at the practice of sa-asmita samādhi, having reached the very depth of nature, you would have become the Master of Nature. Such people are called the siddha puruṣas, or the gods who control the different phenomena—Indra, Varuṇa, Agni, and so on, according to the Hindu names. Yoga sutras of [[Patanjali]]
