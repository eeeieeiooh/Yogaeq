## The Gap Between Stimulus and Response

- There Is A [[The Gap]]
- All we are talking about is noticing the gap in between a stimulus and a response.
- There is a gap in between a stimulus and response
- You can choose what to do in this gap
- You can tune into your autonomic nervous system which isn't usually noticeable as a reminder to yourself that you there is so much that slips under the surface of your radar.

## What is Meditation?

- What is the ultimate goal of meditation? To notice your thoughts, not control them.
- The key point in spiritual teachings: awareness, consciousness.

## Daily Practice

- I suggest deliberately practicing overcoming this gap every day.
- This is a daily practice of doing something that you don't want to do. For me that's a cold shower and talking with people. I talk to legit everyone nowadays. I force myself to. If a thought pops into my head about saying hello on an elevator, I don't even think about it. Cold showers work the same too.

## Learning to Control Reactions

- Learning to control reactions. I will interchange a lot of words hopefully triggering different ideas in your head. Desires. Impulses. Immediate gratification.

## A couple of crunchy solutions that have worked for me:

- Every time I think a thought I don't want to think I thank it and appreciate it for when it was useful for me. A previous version of myself may have found it useful
- blog idea: layers of information don't mean anything. spiritual sayings for instant meant shit until it all just clicked. why is this? what can we do about it?

## Two Questions

- Two Questions: What am I worried about and What can I do about it?

## Perspective: Scale and Insignificance

- There are a few things that no matter are jaw dropping.
- How about the pure scale of the universe and the pure insignificance of literally everything we do. Contemplate that for a second and watch your worries be crushed into the smallest form like the sun could do to the earth at any moment. Or any star for that matter.
- The world doesn't revolved [around you]

## Freedom is my rationalist version of spirituality

- Acknowledging something greater than yourself.
- Something that fuels you.
- Some people its god.
- Some people its their kids.
- Some people its the greater humanity.
- Admitting that you are not the center of the universe and a practice to remind yourself of that.

## A Spiritual Practice for Rationalists

- Meditation

## Testing Your Practice With Family

- Ram Dass earlier, of a quote of his that I like, and I'm gonna paraphrase, I'm sure. But if you think you're enlightened, go spend a week with your family.
- tim ferris: "Have a lot of triggers related to family members"
- one need not go home for more than a couple days to see
