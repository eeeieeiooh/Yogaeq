> This newsletter exists to fight the myopia of the moment. I don't talk about the news, politics, or current events. Instead, it’s my explicit aim to eject you from the Never-Ending Now and direct you toward timeless wisdom.

A place for wisdom—sayings, fables, and riddles, aphorisms, proverbs, koans, parables, paradoxes and that stuff.

The Myths that make us. The stories that illuminate.
