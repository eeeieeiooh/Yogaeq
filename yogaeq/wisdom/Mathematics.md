## The Problem with Math Education

There's something I've wanted to talk about for a very long time: how school literally drains all the fun out of math. Like all high school students, I remember asking my high school teacher where this will be applied and her not having a good answer.

When you think of math you most likely think back to your high school or college days or potentially your present moment. A time characterized by uncontrollable hormones and anguish over your looming deadlines.

I have yet to meet a person who has loved their mathematics class. I am not the biggest fan of math either, but I did study it extensively for my Computer Science degree. I was a much bigger fan of high level concepts rather than nitty gritty numbers.

## My Personal Experience

Excuse me while I nerd out for a sec.

Discrete Structures was one of my favorite classes in college. Not because of my terrible professor who copied notes from the textbook to the blackboard verbatim, nor because of my struggle with keeping up with it, but rather because of the interesting concepts interlaced between the hard math.

## The Beauty of Math

I think math is a beautiful language. Just like the ones we speak to communicate.

But math is all around us. It's the language of the universe. Here let me explain: Go get string. Cut it in half. That's an octave higher.

Have you ever wondered why harmonizing sounds so good? Math can help shed some insight onto what's happening.

I especially love mathematical laws. The beauty of math is depicting real life scenarios with numbers. I love the ideas of limits - you never get there.
