**Isha**: The Inner Ruler. The Self is everywhere. Bright is the Self,  Indivisible, untouched by sin, wise. Immanent and transcendent. Who holds the cosmos together.

**Sandhya Kala:** a Sanskrit term that describes the transition time – around sunrise and sunset and at noon – that is the best time to meditate. The term comes from san, meaning "good"; dhya, meaning "meditate"; and kala, meaning "time." Some believe that the times around sunrise, sunset and noon are the best times to meditate because the flow of energy through the _sushumna____nadi_ (the body's primary energy channel) is upward during sandhya kala. There are, therefore, greater benefits from meditation, pranayama and other yogic practices during sandhya kala.

**Sanatana:** The word "Sanatana" literally means "eternal". It is that which has no beginning nor end; was never born nor will ever die. God alone is eternal. God is Santhana and the dharma/law/duty mandated by Him is Sanatana Dharama.
