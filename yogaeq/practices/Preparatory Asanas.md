- **The Practice: **
	- Prior to the start of the practice of *Shambhavi Mahamudra kriya*, a minute of reflection on the basic precepts

presented during the program is then observed followed by the performance of 5

minutes of 3 gentle, preparatory yoga *asanas* (postures).

Subsequently, the 21-minute *kriya* (inner

action) begins and is practiced in *Siddhasana* (accomplished

pose), which is a cross-legged posture with left heel pressing the

perineum. __Shambhavi

Mahamudra* begins with *pranayama* (controlled yogic breathing) called *Sukha Kriya* or *Nadi Shodhana,__ which

is an alternate-nostril breathing technique (ie, a slow-paced *pranayama*) to encourage balance in the mind for 6 to 7 minutes,

followed by 21 long repetitions of the *bija mantra* (root

syllable) *Om* chanted aloud with the thumb and forefinger

touching in *jnana* (wisdom) *mudra* (seal).

Next, the breathing exercise *Viparita Swasa* or *Bhastrika pranayama* (ie, a fast-paced *pranayama*) is practiced for 3 to 4 minutes and concludes with

breath retention (*kumbhaka* or vessel) on both the inhalation and the

exhalation while actively engaging the *bandhas* (muscular

and energetic contraction) on the pelvic floor (*moola bandha*),

lower abdomen (__uddiyana

bandha*), and throat (*jalandhara bandha*). Finally, the *Shambhavi kriya__ practice

concludes with a 5-minute period of *Vipassana* meditation

(*dhyana*) or open-monitoring meditation. The *Shambhavi Mahamudra kriya* takes approximately 21 minutes to complete.

Please note that this outline of the *kriya* is intended

for research purposes only; the *Shambhavi Mahamudra* practice

should be learned under the instruction and observation of a qualified teacher.


- Shambhavi is a

habit. Same time. Same way. Its not just like ‘random’ meditation


- Shambhavi is a

practie that is awesome.


- Fixes to practice:

exhale left nostril first (not inhale).Switch every inhale. The cat cow is

4x3x3. Down up down up down up down up down up


- Try focusing your gaze

in the middle of your eyebrows. Strain your eyes.


2. When eyes gaze fixed at the eyebrow center properly, it can help in strengthening weak eye muscles. Thus problems like Ptosis (drooping of one or both eyelids) and Double vision (diplopia) can be resolved.
3. Shambhavi mudra leads to Samadhi, the last limb of Yoga. By mastering Shambhavi, perfect concentration comes, from perfect concentration meditation comes and perfect meditation is Samadhi itself.
4. From a scientific point of view, Shambhavi activates the pineal gland which secretes the serotonin hormone to keep us calm and regulates our subconscious mind. Further, the subconscious mind is a powerhouse of energy and reduces the stimulation of cortisol hormone when we get angry. This way, it activates energy, passion, and insight to direct one's life
