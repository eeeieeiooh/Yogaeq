> And Now, Yoga – Patanjali


YogaEQ is a space for yoga notes, practice reflections, and things I want to keep close.

You may ask yourself [[Why Yoga?]]

This website is meant to be stripped down to a minimalist. 

Mixing a practice of knowledge and understanding of yoga with the practice therein. 

Please acknowledge that I'm constantly learning as well. This website is for all that care to grow with me along my [[Practice]]. 

Its an attempt consistently bettering ourselves for humanity while remaining at peace.

But please note, you do not need to know anything about yoga to practice. 

Why Me? 

Fascinated by the study of [[Breathe]] and how we are intimitately tied. 

Im a long time meditator and yoga Practitioner. 

Deciphering the abstract concepts of yoga and putting them in terms for a westener. 

Sometimes it feels like we consume information without remembering it. Organization is part of yoga. 

You do not need to immerse yourself in Hinduism or Mantras to reap the benefits of Yoga. Stillness and Awareness is what is required. Practice through Sadhana.

Some people are naturally more receptive.
